This analysis leverages R Programming to explore a dataset through data manipulation, statistical evaluation, and visualization techniques. It includes data cleaning, variable identification, and the creation of new variables through mathematical transformations. Statistical functions such as mean, median, and mode are calculated, along with data visualization through scatter and bar plots. The study also employs linear regression to examine correlations between variables, offering insights into the dataset's dynamics and patterns.
